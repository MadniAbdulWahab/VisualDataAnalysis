# Visual Data Analysis Course

## 🎓 Course Name: Visual Data Analysis
## 📚 Institution: Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn

### Overview

Welcome to the repository for the "Visual Data Analysis" course that I successfully completed as part of my Master's program in Computer Science at the University of Bonn. This course provided me with an in-depth exploration of the exciting field of data visualization and analysis, equipping me with valuable skills and knowledge.

### Course Highlights

Throughout this comprehensive course, I immersed myself in a diverse array of topics related to data visualization:

- 📊 **Dimensionality Reduction Techniques:** I mastered advanced techniques such as PCA, Kernel PCA, t-SNE, LDA, and IsoMap to reduce high-dimensional data for effective visualization.
- 🌈 **Color Perception and Utilization:** I gained insights into human color perception and learned how to harness the power of color in data visualizations for maximum impact.
- 🗺️ **Geographical Maps:** I delved into the intricacies of geographical data representation, covering various map projections, including cylindrical and non-pseudo cylindrical.
- 📈 **Basic Visualization Techniques:** I honed my skills in essential visualization methods, including scatterplots, boxplots, star glyphs, star coordinates, parallel coordinates, pie plots, barplots, and histograms.
- 🧬 **Scientific Visualization:** I navigated the complexities of scientific visualization, including the interpretation of X-ray, CT scan, and MR scan data, as well as volume rendering, isosurfaces, and more.
- 🐍 **Libraries and Tools:** I harnessed the power of Python and a wide range of libraries such as pandas, numpy, plotly, matplotlib, Dash, scikit-learn, seaborn, and the formidable VTK (Visualization Toolkit). Additionally, I explored data visualization with the ParaView application.
